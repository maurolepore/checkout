Description: The goal of this package is to checkout a set of
    git repositories in a way similar to
    <https://github.com/actions/checkout>, to reproduce locally what you
    may usually do in GitHub actions. It is most useful to test locally
    the latest commit of the working directory in the context of the
    master branch of one or multiple other repositories.
