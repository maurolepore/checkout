# checkout

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to checkout a set of git repositories in a
way similar to <https://github.com/actions/checkout>, to reproduce
locally what you may usually do in GitHub actions. It is most useful to
test locally the `HEAD` of the working directory in the context of the
master branch of one or multiple other repositories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of checkout from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maurolepore/checkout")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(checkout)
## basic example code
```
